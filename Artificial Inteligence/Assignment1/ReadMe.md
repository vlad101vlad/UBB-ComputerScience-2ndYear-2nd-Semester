# A.I.

## First Assignment - Exploration in a simple environment

We have a drone, placed in an unknown environment. We want this drone to map this
environment, into a predefined area.
In order to simplify the problem we consider only the movement in plan.
First step is to model this environment. The drone will explore a certain rectangular area ​ _A​_.
We divide this area in small squares of size length ​ _u_ that will fit loosely the drone (lets say ​ _u
=  55_ cm). If the square is empty it will be marked zero, if it is
occupied it is marked with 1.
The problem modeled like this is reduced to map a simple
labyrinth. For this we use 4  of the ​Ultrasonic Distance
Measuring Sensors (we use all  6  of them if we map a 3D space
instead of a plan area). The  4  sensors will give us the distances
to the obstacles from a point in 4 directions.
So the drone’s sensors will detect the 3u, 0, u, and u values. So in
order to map the surroundings we will need to move the drone,
more or less on each empty square at least one time.
Consider now an algorithm like DFS, or other of the same type, and
we want to map the surroundings with it.

## Task


Using a DFS type of algorithm, design a function that can be used by a drone to map a
rectangular area of size ​ _n x n_ units ​ _u ​_ starting from an empty square​_._ The area is unknown
to the drone, the only information will come from the sensors (we will simulate that on the
application, using a function ​ _readUDMSensors​_ ), so at every step the drone will receive  4 
values - the number of empty squares to the next occupied one. From each position the
drone can move in one empty adjacent empty square.
In the end we can compare the constructed map with the “real” environment.
This “real” environment will be encoded in a matrix in the class Environment​_. ​_ The ​ **only way**
the drone receives information from this matrix is through the ​ _readUDMSensors._
Your detected map is an object from class DMap. in a position on this map for now you
can have 3 values:

_1._ -1 unknown value, unexplored
2. 0 an empty square
3. 1 a wall
You have to write the ​ _moveDSF_ function from the Drone class. The function will be called in
the main function in the main loop of the application.
For that you have to erase the handler for the keypress event, and add the call for the
moveDFS function and the time delay.
ATTENTION!! In one call you have to move the drone one square. Overall the moves should
respect the DSF pattern of visit.
When there are no more empty squares to visit (the search is at end, the stack is empty)
the position of the drone will be set to none ( ​ _x = None, y = None​_ ).
