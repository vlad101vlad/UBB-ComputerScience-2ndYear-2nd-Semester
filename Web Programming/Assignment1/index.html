        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am passionate Computer Science student eager to gain experience in the programming industry. My curiosity
        is endless and I use every oportunity to broaden my knowledge</p>

        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p>I like doing anything outdoors. Some sports I play are: football, tennis, basketball and ping-pong. I also like
        to ride my bike on steep terrains or dive in the nearby rivers when the weather is hot. Durring the winter, I like skiing.
        Here is a video of me skiing.</p>

        <p>
            Since I enjoy dancing, music is also a very important part in my life. I like numerous genres of music but
            recently I have been listening to a lot of heavy metal. I have attached a sample of that below :)

        <h5>Quick info</h5>
        <aside>Studies show that faster-paced music tends to help improve athletic performance when a person engages in
            low-to-moderate level exercise, either by increasing distance travelled, pace, or repetitions completed.
            [2] For example, a 2006 study that looked at the effect of music on the selection of treadmill speed found
            that while listening to fast-paced music, participants increased their pace and distance travelled without
            becoming more tired.[3] Other studies drew similar conclusions,[4] suggesting that listening to music with
            more beats per minute can enhance physical performance during low-to-moderate level exercise.</aside>
